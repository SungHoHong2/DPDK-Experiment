- **problem**
  - OpenFlow and other solutions provide high flexibility in the control plane, the data plane is restricted to a subset of existing protocol headers,
  - P4 [4, 2] have been proposed to overcome this limitation by enabling to describe packet forwarding in an abstract, protocol independent way


- **solution**
  - Our aim was to develop a high-performance P4 compiler with flexible retargetability
  - `the hardware dependent functionalities` are defined by a Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) that has to be implemented for each target .
  - the `core compiler` remains independent of the actual hardware
