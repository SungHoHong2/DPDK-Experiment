### [Packet processing on FPGA SoC with DPDK](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7577395)

- **abstract**
   - packet processing in data centers with respect to the power consumption and efficient utilization of computational resources.
   - The ARM architecture has proved to be an energy efficient computational system
   - Together with an integrated FPGA on a single die, it offers potentially a high performance with respect to the power consumption

   - exploit the potential of packet processing based on DPDK and FPGA SoC architectures

   - The DPDK has been designed to support only PCI-specific devices. There is no standard way how to integrate a SoCspecific (non-PCI) peripherals into DPDK
