### [DPDK Open vSwitch performance validation with mirroring feature](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7500387)

- **problem**
  - Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Network (SDN) currently play a key role to transform the network architecture from hardware-based to software-based
  - Along with cloud computing, NFV and SDN are moving network functions from dedicated hardware to software implementation (Virtual Network Functions â€“ VNF), on Virtual Machine (VM) or other virtualization technology such as containers, on top of a virtualized platform in the Cloud
  -  To connect the VNFs, hosted in the same Data Center (DC) or across multiple DCs, virtual switches are required.
  - Besides forwarding functions, virtual switches can be configured to mirror traffics for network management needs.
  - Open vSwitch (OVS) is the most known and used. OVS is open source, and included in most of the existing Linux distributions
  - However, OVS performance in terms of throughput for smaller packets is very smaller than of line rate of the interface.

- **solution**
  - OVS was ported to Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), namely OVDK.
  - The latter achieves an impressive line rate throughput across physical interfaces.

- **conclusion**
  - we present the result of OVDK performance test when flow and port mirroring are activated, which was not tested so far
  - The performance test focuses on two parameters, throughput and latency in OVDK
  - allowing to validate the use of OVDK for flow forwarding and network management in the envisioned virtualized network architecture
