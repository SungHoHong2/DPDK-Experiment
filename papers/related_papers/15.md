- **conclusion**
  - create an optimized architecture for virutal switch


- **the advent of network function virtualization**
  -  the use of software defined networking and the use of virtualization to exploit common off-the-shelf hardware to provide a wide array of network-resident functions

  - designed network function virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is needed
  - `software-based network services` broadens the type of networking capabilities offered in provider networks and cloud platforms by allowing network services to be dynamically deployed across shared hosts
  -  Part of that evolution will be in moving a limited amount of autonomy for decision making to a “smarter data plane.”


- **service naming**
  - introducing the idea of “names” for services, rather than continuing to retain the traditional location-based identification of service functions in the network, will further improve the performance and flexibility of SDN in an NFVbased network environment.
  - Software-based network resident functions, such as functions to modify packet headers (e.g., NAT, proxy), examine and allow or block packet flows
  - But these functions only need to be applied to certain packets.
  - Implementing them in software can provide powerful flexibility to a service provider to place such services at optimal points in the packet flow, rather than in a particular location in the network topology and routing packets to them.

- **smart data plane**
  - We emphasize that there is a role to be played by the data plane in helping the control plane make better decisions, by providing state information that is critical in making policy decisions as well as making choices for routing of traffic flows, such as with network traffic engineering
  - we can also make simple decisions based on a priority guidelines from the controller to immediately guide some network flows that would otherwise require communication with the controller resulting in both overhead and latency
  -  evolution of middleboxes, this trend shifted to software-based distinct engines that were located at strategic points in the network or at best were appendages to the network forwarding elements
  - seeks to put capabilities exactly when and where they are needed, dynamically
  - Having service names enables an approach that separates the functions a flow needs from the location of network function instances.
  - Having service names enables an approach that separates the functions a flow needs from the location of network function instances.
  - architecture allows the SDN application to compose complex network services by populating rules across multiple hosts.
