### Network stack challenges at increasing speeds

- **conclusion**
  - gives a very good info about how to optimize the speed in general, and this applies to both RDMA and DPDK.


- **challenges of 100gbits**
  - increasing network speeds
  - `rate increase` time between packets get smaller
  - `time used in network stack` needs to be smaller to keep up with the rates


- **if no 100Gbits NIC**
  - use 10Gibts with smaller frames


- **network stack bypass**
  - Like netmap, PF_RING/DNA, DPDK, PacketShader,
  - RDMA and IBverbs avail in kernel, long time
  - kernel is not using HW optimally
    - with artificial network benchmarks hw can forward 10Gbits wire speed smallest packet

- **time-scale issues**
  - cache-miss
  - lock prefix
  - system call
  - sync mechanism

- **alternatives of DPDK**
  - netmap PF_RING/DNA
  - PacketShader
  - OpenOnload

- **solutions for time-scale issues**
  - batching, preallocation, prefetching
  - staying cpu/numa local, avoid locking,
  - shrink meta data to a minimum, reduce syscalls
  - faster cache-optimal data structures
  - lower instruction-cache misses
