### [A new model for DPDK-based virtual switches](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8004211)


- **conclusion**
  - This paper deals with the modeling of a virtual switch architecture taking into account the switch-over times (amount of time needed for a CPU core to switch from one queue to another).

- **problem**
  - the behavior of virtual switches is a major concern in determining the overall network performance
  - we develop a general framework for the modeling and the analysis of DPDK-based virtual switches
  - Our model delivers performance metrics such as the buffer occupancy, the loss rate and the sojourn time of a packet in RX queues

  -  Software defined networking (SDN) outsources all the decision-making networking functions into a (set of) controller(s) in charge of determining how to handle the incoming traffic.
  - networking devices, such as routers, load balancers, and firewalls are replaced by appliances receiving their instructions
  - Network function virtualization (NFV) refers to the gradual move of network functions out of dedicated hardware devices and into software

- **definition of virtual switch**
  - Therefore, in an SDN/NFV-enabled network, the nodes forwarding, filtering or performing other advanced operations on the traffic are typically referred to as virtual switches
  - they are software-implemented and not deciding the rules.
  - network programmability combined with the softwarization of its functions allows a greater extent of flexibility in the way network operators handle their resources

- **dimensioning network**
   - usual overprovisioning strategy, an operator will scale up and down its resources as the demand varies
   - For instance, when more bandwidth is required on a virtual switch, additional physical resources, e.g., CPU cores, can be provisioned to take part of the load


- **solution**
  - develop a general framework that first decomposes the virtual switch into several poling systems
  - subsequently decompose each polling system into several queueing systems with server vacation
