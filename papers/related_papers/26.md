### [Big Data Technologies for Ultra-High-Speed Data Transfer and Processing](https://www.intel.co.id/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/big-data-xeon-processor-e5-ultra-high-speed-aspera-whitepaper.pdf)

- **summary**
  - major challenge in high-performance cloud computing is being able to move big data in and out of the backend data center.
    - high-performance servers and hardware are already deployable inside the data center
    - WAN bandwidth can be provisioned beyond multi-Gbps

- **solution**
  - Aspera develops high-speed data transfer technologies that provide speed, efficiency, and bandwidth control over any file size, transfer distance, network condition, and storage location
  - Aspera’s patented fasp* transport technology is designed and implemented to have no theoretical throughput limit
  - Maximum transfer speeds are limited only by the available network bandwidth
  - Aspera’s distance-neutral transfer performance means users can expect to achieve the same transfer performance over the WAN as they do over the LAN
  - Aspera and Intel investigated ultra-high-speed (10 Gbps and beyond) data transfer solutions built on Aspera’s fasp transport technology and the Intel® Xeon® processor E5-2600 product family.


- **conclusion**
  - the team provided a modern approach to network I/O that is compatible with high-throughput, low-latency disk I/O, virtualized
machines, and high-performance network architectures. This was accomplished with Intel DPDK, which offers high-performance I/O routines optimized to take advantage of NUMA
  - Furthermore, users with ultra-high-speed transfer needs could significantly reduce the operating costs of transferring data into public cloud infrastructures by dramatically reducing the number of nodes involved in such transfers.
