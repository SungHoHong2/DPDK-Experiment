### [DEMU: A DPDK-based network latency emulator](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972145)

- **essence**
  - it is about dpdk enabled packet generator that performs better than other benchmarks


- **abstract**
  - **background**
    - a network latency emulator allows IT architects to thoroughly investigate how network latencies impact workload performance
    - existing software-based tools built in the network stack of an operating system are not capable of supporting the bandwidth of today’s standard interconnects
  - **solution**
    -  propose a network latency emulator `(DEMU)`
    - `DEMU` supports supporting broad bandwidth traffic with sub-milliseconds accuracy
    - `DEMU` can emulate latencies on the order of 10 µs for short-packet traffic at the line rate of 10GbE.


- **introduction**
  - a tool to emulate network latencies is essential to find the best combination of various networking Technologies  
  - **it uses DPDK to create a benchmark thats it**
