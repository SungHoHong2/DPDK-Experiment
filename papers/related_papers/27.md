### - [OpenFunction: An extensible data plane abstraction protocol for platform-independent software-defined middleboxes](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7784463)


- **introduction**
  - Data plane abstraction is central to Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
  - SDN data plane abstraction has only been realized for switches by OpenFlow
  - but not for middleboxes
  - Switches (including routers in the broader sense) provide packet forwarding
  - Middleboxes are used for wide variety of networking and security purposes such as Network Address Translation (NAT), Load Balancing (LB), firewalls (FW), proxies, IPSec gateways (VPN), and network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).


- **solution**
  - realize the vision of software-define middleboxes (SDM).
  - SDMs provide network operator the ability to dynamically load/unload various network functions without changing the network hardware,
  - a data plane abstraction should be both platform `independent` and fully `extensible`
  - Platform `independence` decouples the data plane function semantics and the underlying hardware that realizes the network function.
  - `extensible` - new middlebox functionality can be defined by an SDM program abstraction
  - propose OpenFunction, an extensible and platform independent data plane abstraction protocol for software-defined middleboxes
