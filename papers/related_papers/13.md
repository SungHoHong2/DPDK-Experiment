- **solution**
  -  `propose a benchmarking tool` that allows the user to measure the important performance metrics of any network functio realized on any hardware and software combination
  - compare the results based on different drivers
  - compare the results from different traffic traces  
  - in different environments



- **problem**
  - We believe that a NF benchmarking tool should not be limited to only a subset of available technologies,
  - `NFPA`  is a standalone benchmarking tool, connected to the Device Under Test (DUT), as depicted in Fig. 1: the NF to be tested runs in the desired environment
  -  details of the hardware and software components, number of repeated measurements and their duration, and selects the traffic traces to be used
