### [PacketUsher: a DPDK-Based Packet I/O Engine for Commodity PC](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636896)


- **abstract**
  - Deploying network applications on commodity PC is increasingly important because of its flexibility and cheapness
  - we present PacketUsher, an efficient packet I/O engine based on the libraries of DPDK
  - standard I/O routine with PacketUsher, we can remarkably accelerate both I/O-intensive and compute-intensive applications on commodity PC
