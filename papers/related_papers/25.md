### [Agile and fine programmable optical interconnection provisioning in data center network](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8024763)

- **conclusion**
  - this is an application of combining DPDK with other data-center architecture  

- **abstract**
  -  interconnection provisioning in Data Center (DC) draws lots of interests thanks to its high bandwidth
and power efficiency.
-  Optical TDM connection is an alternative solution to enable port sharing but with guaranteed bandwidth
-  At the same time, since the throughput of traffic in DC is fluctuating through time, it is quite critical to adjust the TDM slot allocation dynamically according to the actual traffic demands
- DCN must support a variety of data flows, including a majority of bursty and latency sensitive "mice" flows and a few persistent and throughput-sensitive "elephant" flows that carry most of data(around 80%)
- A lot of research have revealed that elephant flow would lead to performance degradation of mice flow
- DCN together with its control and management system need to be able to efficiently differentiate and deliver these flows according to their own characteristics and applicationsâ€™ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements


- **solution**
  - In order to tackle these challenges, optical switching technology is a promising solution for DCN data plane
due to their attractive features, such as high bandwidth, low power consumption, and low cabling complexity
  - Some of them employ hybrid optical-electrical switch architecture, where optical circuit switches (OCS) are used
for high bandwidth slowly changing communication between the Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, such as c-Through and Helios
