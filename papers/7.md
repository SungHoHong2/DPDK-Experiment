### [User-Specific Network Service Functions in an SDN-enabled Network Node](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984072)

- **problem**
  - Network Functions Virtualization can enable each user (tenant) to define his desired set of network services, called (network) service graph
  -  For instance, a User1 may want his traffic to traverse a firewall before reaching his terminal, while a User2 may be interested in a different type of firewall and in a network monitor as well
  -instantiate the userâ€™s network service graph and force all his traffic to traverse the proper set of network


- **solution**
- This paper focuses on the case in which users are given the possibility to define their own service graph
-  made up of a set of NFs chosen by the user himself and that operate solely on his traffic.
- The service graph is stored in a user profiles database and it is used when the network recognizes an user terminal that belong to the user himself

- **introductions**
  - proposes to transform the network functions
  - run on dedicated appliances (e.g., firewall, WAN accelerator), into a set of software images, which can be consolidated into high-volume standard server
    - supported by the power of computing virtualization technologies and software switches.
  - enable the creation of network service chains that can be finely customized
  - focuses on the case in which users are given the possibility to define their own `service graph`
    - each user to defined his own preferred set of network services, called (network) `service graphs`.


- **definition of service graph**
  - service graph is stored in a user profiles database
  - used when the network recognizes an user terminal


- **what the system do in the paper**
  - reconfigure the network paths inside the node and instantiate the NFs
  - `reconfiguring` requires the network to translate the service graph, which includes only high-level information such as the chosen NF
  - `reconfiguring` requires the network to translate their service order, into a more precise representation called Network Functions


- **architecture**
  - `global orchestrator` is the module in charge of authenticating a user connecting to the network node
  - Upon receiving the information that a new user terminal is connected to one of the physical ports of the node, the orchestrator retrieves the correct `Service Graph (SG)`
  - outputs the corresponding Network Functions `Forwarding Graph (NF-FG)`
  - The traffic steering among the elements of the NF-FG is based on `xDPd`
    - a software switch that allows to dynamically create several software Openflow switches, called `Logical Switch Instances (LSIs)`
  - LSIs access to the network ports using the DPDK framework
  - the igb driver is used in case of physical interfaces
  - rte_rings are used to exchange packets with NFs, according to the type of NFs themselves
