### [User-Specific Network Service Functions in an SDN-enabled Network Node](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984072)

- **problem**
  - Network Functions Virtualization can enable each user (tenant) to define his desired set of network services, called (network) service graph
  -  For instance, a User1 may want his traffic to traverse a firewall before reaching his terminal, while a User2 may be interested in a different type of firewall and in a network monitor as well
  -instantiate the userâ€™s network service graph and force all his traffic to traverse the proper set of network


- **solution**
- This paper focuses on the case in which users are given the possibility to define their own service graph
-  made up of a set of NFs chosen by the user himself and that operate solely on his traffic.
- The service graph is stored in a user profiles database and it is used when the network recognizes an user terminal that belong to the user himself
