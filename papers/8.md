### [DPDK-based Improvement of Packet Forwarding](https://www.itm-conferences.org/articles/itmconf/pdf/2016/02/itmconf_ita2016_01009.pdf)

- **problem**
  - High-speed network packet forwarding system plays a vital role in many fields, such as packet analysis, virus detection and traffic management.
  - Universal NIC runs into a big bottleneck in many aspects, such as data buffering, packet copy and frequent interruptions which causes huge overhead
  - For the host, it causes excessive consumption of the computing, storage, I/O overhead which is too large to meet the requirements of line-speed data capture and handling on the Gigabit link.

- **solution**
  - In this paper, we analyze the key technologies of DPDK, and take advantage of DPDK framework to build a packet forwarding system.
  - In the process of DMA transfer,DPDK needs to send descriptor separately, which wasted PCIe bandwidth, resulting in a performance bottleneck, therefore we propose a new method named Minimum Overhead DMA to solve this problem.

- **conclusion**
 - proposed the Minimum Overhead DMA mode using descriptors and packets sending together to improve the utilization of PCIe bandwidth
 - Experimental results show that MODMA can effectively solve the performance bottleneck of DPDK packet forwarding
 - make the system performance, especially in condition of the 64 byte packets improve significantly
