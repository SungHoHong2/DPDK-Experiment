### [Supporting Fine-Grained Network Functions through Intel DPDK](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984043)

- **Problem**
  - Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) aims to transform network functions into software images, executed on standard, high-volume hardware.
  - focuses on the case in which a massive number of (tiny) network function instances are executed simultaneously on the same server

- **Solution**
  - proposes different possible architectures, it characterizes the resulting implementations,
  - it evaluates their applicability under different constraints.
  - In particular, efficient data exchange is one of the requirements mentioned in the deliverable
  - which provides the functional specification of a platform that is potentially able to deliver both computing and network virtualized services.
  - each one targeting a specific working condition, for transferring data between the virtual switch
  - Our goals include the necessity to scale with the number of NFs running on the server, which means that we should ensure high throughput and low latency even in case of a massive number of NFs operating concurrently, each one potentially traversed by a limited amount of traffic.

- **Conclusion**
  - Results obtained, particularly in terms of throughput, are quite satisfying for almost all the implementations proposed
  - goodness of the primitives exported by the DPDK;
  - only in few cases we spotted some limitations which are specific of our target domain
  - **In general, when the number of NF exceeded 100, the average latency experienced by the packets may become unacceptable in
real implementations.**
  - may not be satisfied with the current generation of the hardware, in which CPUs are dimensioned for a few, fat, jobs, while we have here many, tiny tasks.
  - This suggests that our future investigations should take into consideration different hardware platforms, such as the ones with a massive number of (tiny) cores, which may be more appropriate for our case
