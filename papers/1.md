### [Removing Roadblocks from SDN: OpenFLow Software Switch Performance on Intel DPDK](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680560)


- **definition**
  - **Software Defined Networking**
    - The physical separation of the network control plane from the forwarding plane, and where a control plane controls several devices.
    - This architecture decouples the network control and forwarding functions
    - Enabling the network control to become directly programmable
    - Underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network services.
  - **Control plane**
    - Learning what we will do
    - this planning and learning can be done through static routes, where we train the router about remote networks, and how to get there.
    - Dynamic routing protocols, like RIP, OSPF and EIGRP to allow the routers to train each other regarding how to reach remote networks.
  - **Data plane**
    - Actualy moving the packets based on what we learned.
    - the part of a network that carries user traffic
    - sometimes called the data plane or user plane, defines the part of the router architecture that decides what to do with packets arriving on an inbound interface.
    - examples are dropping the packets and receiving the packets

- **SDN (Software-Defined Network)**
  - **Problem**
      - `SDN` visions of more flexible and manageable network but require certain level of programmability
      - Inside the `SDN`, one of the programmable data plane implementation is called `Open Flow`
      - `Open Flow` is an abstract switch model
      - `OF 1.0 ` implemented on high-speed Ethernet switch hardware has certain disadvantages in the area of flexibility
      - `OF 1.3` good flexibility, but poor performance

  - **Solution**
      - The paper argues that the overhead of flexibility of `OF 1.3` is relatively low  
      - The reason is due to the lack of optimization in case of flexible implementations
      - Introduce OF using Intel's Data Plane Developement Kit

  - **conclusion**
      - built an OpenFlow software switch prototype based on Intel’s DPDK library to overcome system overhead
      - when using DPDK the protocol’s overhead is relatively small:
      - Flexibility alone, in other words, does not incur high performance penalty in software switch implementations
      - our prototype just supports the basic OF 1.3 functionality and it does it with a naïve approach which seriously limits its scalability

- **Performance issues**
  - OpenFlow is designed to provide a generic and programmable forwarding plane
  - this results in low performance in specific use cases
  - **alogrithmic issues**
    - can only send atomic rules to the switch
    - thus the switch is unaware of the use-case, and cannot apply any specialization / optimization
    - there are a lot of features such as counters, flow timeouts, entry update frequency that hinders the performance
  - **non algorithmatic issues**
    - packet I/O overhead
    - buffering to DRAM
    - interrupt handling
    - overhead of kernel structures

<br>

- **test configuration**
  - `OF` is running on two cores in busy loop
  - egress side each core have one queue per outgoing port so there is no locking on the egress side
  - workstations were super micro workstations
    - Intel 82599EB (2x10GbE) NICs
    - 2 Intel Xeon E5-2630 Sandy Bridge Processors
      - 6 cores running at 2.3 GHz
      - 32kB+32Kb L1 cache
      - 256KB L2 cache
      - 15 MB L3 Cache
  - used codes
    - L2FWD
    - DPDK-PKTGEN
    - OF 1.3 prototype
  - the measurement of the packet sizes
    - 64, 128, 256, 512 bytes


- **Solviing the issues**
  - decreasing the number of rules in the switch will increase performance
  - So in OF if only the first packet of a flow was inspected it will be good.
  - We argue that instead of aiming of whole algorithm careful separation of the rules is most likely a
better solution.
  - This solution would use the control plane to help the dataplane to select the right lookup algorithm in the
selected table.
    - The control plane could send these instructions as part of the table typing pattern (TTP)
    - The control plane could send these instructions as an optional parameter for each table that is defined
    - The data plane could make runtime optimization based on the incoming rules
