### [Removing Roadblocks from SDN: OpenFLow Software Switch Performance on Intel DPDK](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680560)


- **SDN (Software-Defined Network)**
  - Problem
      - vision of more flexible and manageable network but require certain level of programmability
      - `OpenFlow (OF)` which these days is seen a SDN data plane.
      - `OF 1.0 ` implemented on high-speed Ethernet switch hardware has certain disadvantages in the area of flexibility
      - `OF 1.3` good flexibility, but poor performance
  - Solution
      - Introduce OF using Intel's Data Plane Developement Kit
      - argue that the overhead of flexibility is relatively low  

<br>

- **conclusion**
 - built an OpenFlow software switch prototype based on Intel’s DPDK library to overcome system overhead
 - when using DPDK the protocol’s overhead is relatively small:
 - Flexibility alone, in other words, does not incur high performance penalty in software switch implementations
 - our prototype just supports the basic OF 1.3 functionality and it does it with a naïve approach which seriously limits its scalability
