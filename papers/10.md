### [USIW: Design and Implementation of Userspace Software iWARP using DPDK](https://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/C0133441555ACB2785257FA900245C68/$File/rz3894.pdf)  

- **problem**
  - a new form of non-volatile memory NVM emerge in providing efficient remote access to this storage as emerges.
  - Existing protocols such as iSCSI, FIbre Channel and SRP are heavy weight, requiring connection management and setup for each data transfer.
  - these protocols also assume block access, where data only be read or written in fixed-size blocks.
  - however modern NVM is expected to become byte-addressable  

- **solution**
  - new storage protocols are needed. Remote direct access provides a base set of semantics that is useful for accessing byte-addressable NVM. FlashNet implements a lightweight protocol to access storage using RDMA.
  - using DPDK, we present USIW, a userspace RDMA implementation using iWARP over UDP. This provides the first part of userspace analogue to Flash Net.


- **conclusion**
  - Data transfer performed entirely in userspace using DPDK.
  - A Kernel Driver is acceptable where required by the verbs interface but must not be involved in the data transfer path
  - Support the standard OpenFabrics verb interface which is used by most existing RDMA applications
  - Support out-of-order RDMA READ and RDMA WRITE
