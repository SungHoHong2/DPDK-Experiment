### [Comparison of High-Performance Packet Processing Frameworks on NUMA](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883014)

- **abstract**
  - concentrated on comparison of forwarding ability in multiple dimensions among different high-speed packet processing frameworks, such as PF_RING and DPDK
  - comparison of these frameworks' characteristics on multi-core platform, especially on Non-Uniform Memory Access Architecture (NUMA)
  - processing ability focusing on receiving and multithreading characteristics without transmitting in run-tocompletion model and pipeline model


- **introduction**
  - higher-rate packet processing have been put forward, such as polling without interrupts, user mode driver, pthread affmity, huge pages
  - compare on multiple dimensions, such as
    - CPU Frequency,
    - processing load
    - burst size
    - memory
    - latency

  - multithreading perfonnance of these frameworks, such as pipeline, is a hot spot, for multi-core platform play more important roles.
    - Uniform Memory Access Architecture (NUMA).



- **Major Contribution**
  - concentrated on receiving, multithreading and multicore application on NUMA
  - PF_RING ZC is faster than DPDK because of PF_RING ZC's more efficient polling process in spite of PF_RING ZC's worse inter-thread communication


- **Best Distribution Type**
  - RX works in highest rate when RX and workers are all on the same node of NUMA
  - the processing rate ofRX decreases with the growth of the number of works on remote node.


- **conclusion**
  - run-to-completion models in single thread and pipeline models in multi thread were compared on the whole between PF_ R[NG and DPDK separately, after which the difference between PF RING and DPDK's in these models were concluded with analysis.
  - NUMA plays more and more important roles in traffic processing field, the characteristics of multi-core application on NUMA will still be a hot spot.
