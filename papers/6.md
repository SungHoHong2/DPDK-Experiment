### Study on the Implementation of a Virtual Switch using Intel DPDK

- **problem**
  - Nowadays, new information service platforms are appeared from the interconnection of intelligent IT
systems like IoT(Internet of Things). And many companies want to use the new service platform for their new application service.
The companies can apply there new service early which needs small investment and responses adaptively to the fast change of
consumer environment. Using cloud computing technology, the new business service can be introduced as a commercial IT service
for the time to market.

- **solution**
  - implementation of the accelerated virtual switch using Intel DPDK(Data Plane Development Kit), and
evaluates the virtual network functions of the virtual switch which is one of the most important components to build a virtual
network for cloud computing

- **meaning of virtual switch**
  - like VPN using a private network in the huge network, we are using all the different network as one network
  - that is the meaning of virtual switch.
  - As a result virtual switch is used for `cloud computing` and it is `virtualizing the network` section.
  - in case of VLAN, `VLAN` is difficult to construct in the big network environment

- **definition of OpenVswitch**
  - designed to enable massive network automation through programmatic extension,
  - supporting standard management interfaces and protocol
  - support distribution across multiple physical servers
  - has the features of
    - `VLAN` - isolation and traffic filtering
    - `Qos` traffic queuing and shaping
    - `Monitoring`
    - `Automated Control` - Openflow, OVSDB mgmt, protocol
