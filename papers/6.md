### Study on the Implementation of a Virtual Switch using Intel DPDK

- **problem**
  - Nowadays, new information service platforms are appeared from the interconnection of intelligent IT
systems like IoT(Internet of Things). And many companies want to use the new service platform for their new application service.
The companies can apply there new service early which needs small investment and responses adaptively to the fast change of
consumer environment. Using cloud computing technology, the new business service can be introduced as a commercial IT service
for the time to market.

- **solution**
  - implementation of the accelerated virtual switch using Intel DPDK(Data Plane Development Kit), and
evaluates the virtual network functions of the virtual switch which is one of the most important components to build a virtual
network for cloud computing

- **conclusion**
