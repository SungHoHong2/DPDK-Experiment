### information focused on how the DPDK results are evaluated
- [Comparison of Frameworks for High-Performance Packet IO](dpdk_focused/1.md)
  - the paper is really good for evaluating DPDK, we should use this

- [Comparison of High-Performance Packet Processing Frameworks on NUMA](dpdk_focused/2.md)
  - this is also a good but different way of comparing DPDK

### Related Papers
The papers I have searched was mostly unrelated to the performance comparison between DPDK and RDMA <br>
The papers focused on how to improve NFV by using DPDK <br>
Info about how they improved the DPDK was included, but still it was consdiered as one of the factors to increase the overall performance
