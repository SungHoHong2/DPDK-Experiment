### [Enhancing VNF performance by exploiting SR-IOV and DPDK packet processing acceleration](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7387409)

- **problem**
  - The primary goal of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is the migration of physical network functions to software versions running on virtual machines in cloud computing environments
  - Rapid developments in virtualization technologies have made high­ speed network connections and line rate packet processing viable in virtualized infrastructure environments
  - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of network traffic in the form of a computational intensive virtualized network function (VNF) was selected as a representative use­case.
  -

- **solution**
  - The DPI use case was used, to demonstrate the benefits of using SR­IOV enabled devices with DPDK to support performant Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployments
  - Performance evaluation of VNF versions using LibPCAP,SR­IOV and DPDK have been carried out.


- **conclusion**
  - The results demonstrate that significantly higher packet throughput performance can be achieved when using SR­IOV and DPDK in
unison in comparison to packet processing with the native Linux kernel network stack.
  - DPI VNF was implemented both using LibCAP and INtel's DPDK framework. The SR-IOV framework was also used in order to maximize packet throughput in a virtualized environment.
  - various limitations and development restraints have been described
  - The next steps in this work will focus on NUMA and core pinning and optimization of huge page sizes in an effort to achieve near line rate performance for the DPI

- **abstract**
  - The DPI use case was used, to demonstrate the benefits of using SR­IOV enabled devices with DPDK to support
  - `SRIOV` is a specification that allows a PCIe device to appear to be multiple separate physical PCIe devices.
  - `Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)` of network traffic in the form of a computational intensive virtualized network function (VNF) was selected as a representative use­ case.

- **the benefits of SDN and VNF**
  - SDN and NFV will change the network design approach
  - NFV's network model is focused on implementation of software based network functions
  - This concept enables multiple virtualized network functions to operate on the same high-volume server simulatneously
  - The operator gains significant flexibility to dynamicaly start and reconfigure VNF

- **problems with VNF**
  - When multiple VNFs run simultaneously and each one of them processes a significant number of packets per second.


- **introducing SR-IOV**
  - Single Root I/O Virtualization, specification released by PCI-SIG.
  - reduces hypervisor's interaction with VM
  - `SR-IOV` enabled device is capable of spawning various light instances of PCI functions
  - This feature allows multiple VMs to share the same physical PCI devices without achieving CPU overhead

- **introducing DPDK**
  - a set of libraries that support efficient implementation of network functions through access to the NIC
  - DPDK operates in polling mode for packet processing instead of interrupt
- **solution**
  - SR-IOV enabled devices with DPDK to support VNF deployments
  - DPI deep packet inspection of network traffic is used for use case
    - `DPI` provides packet analysis and flow information which consume a significant amount of resources  
    - DPI is primarily used to identify network traffic profiles for various management purpose


- **how the test was conducted**
  - The first test was performed at the physical layer
  - DPI application was executed directly using physical NIC
  - second test was deployed as VM through a KVM hypervisor with the packets arriving through an SR-IOV fast path.
  - evaluated by comparing LibPCAP and DPDK
  - used `netmap` for packet processing

- **two execution models of DPDK**
  - `pipeline model` one core has the capability of transferring the packets from the receiving NIC to a second core for processing it.
  - `run to completion model` where packets are distributed among all cores for accelerated processing.
  - the features of packet scheduling and the different execution models make the DPDK framework more than just an I/O library.


- **Experiment Results**
  - results of comparison between DPDK and LibPCAP version of the DPI in physical and virtualized environment
  - results for the effect of combining SR-IOV
