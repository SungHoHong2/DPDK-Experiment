### [Enhancing VNF performance by exploiting SR-IOV and DPDK packet processing acceleration](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7387409)

- **problem**
  - The primary goal of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is the migration of physical network functions to software versions running on virtual machines in cloud computing environments
  - Rapid developments in virtualization technologies have made high­ speed network connections and line rate packet processing viable in virtualized infrastructure environments
  - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of network traffic in the form of a computational intensive virtualized network function (VNF) was selected as a representative use­case.
  -

- **solution**
  - The DPI use case was used, to demonstrate the benefits of using SR­IOV enabled devices with DPDK to support performant Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployments
  - Performance evaluation of VNF versions using LibPCAP,SR­IOV and DPDK have been carried out.


- **conclusion**
  - The results demonstrate that significantly higher packet throughput performance can be achieved when using SR­IOV and DPDK in
unison in comparison to packet processing with the native Linux kernel network stack.
  - DPI VNF was implemented both using LibCAP and INtel's DPDK framework. The SR-IOV framework was also used in order to maximize packet throughput in a virtualized environment.
  - various limitations and development restraints have been described
  - The next steps in this work will focus on NUMA and core pinning and optimization of huge page sizes in an effort to achieve near line rate performance for the DPI
